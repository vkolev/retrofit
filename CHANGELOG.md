Change Log
==========

Version 2.0.0-beta1 *(2015-08-27)*
----------------------------------

 * New: `Call` encapsulates a single request/response HTTP call. A call can be run synchronously
   via `execute()` or asynchronously via `enqueue()` and can be canceled with `cancel()`.
 * New: `Response` is now parameterized and includes the deserialized body object.
 * New: `@Url` parameter annotation allows passing a complete URL for an endpoint.
 * New: OkHttp is now required as a dependency. Types like `TypedInput` and `TypedOutput` (and its
   implementations), `Request`, and `Header` have been replaced with OkHttp types like `RequestBody`,
   `ResponseBody`, and `Headers`.
 * New: `CallAdapter` (and `Factory`) provides extension point for supporting multiple execution
   mechanisms. An RxJava implementation is provided by a sibling module.
 * New: `Converter` (and `Factory`) provides extension point for supporting multiple serialization
   mechanisms. Gson, Jackson, Moshi, Protobuf, Wire, and SimpleXml implementations are provided by sibling
   modules.
 * Fix: A lot of things.
 * Hello Droidcon NYC 2015!


Version 1.9.0 *(2015-01-07)*
----------------------------

 * Update to OkHttp 2.x's native API. If you are using OkHttp you must use version 2.0 or newer (the latest
   is 2.2 at time of writing) and you no longer need to use the `okhttp-urlconnection` shim.
 * New: Allow disabling Simple XML Framework's strict parsing.
 * New: `@Header` now accepts a `List` or array for a type.
 * New: `@Field` and `@FieldMap` now have options for enabling or disabling URL encoding of names and values.
 * Fix: Remove query parameters from thread name when running background requests for asynchronous use.


Version 1.8.0 *(2014-11-18)*
----------------------------

 * Update to RxJava 1.0. This comes with the project's 'groupId' change from `com.netflix.rxjava` to
   `io.reactivex` which is why the minor version was bumped.


Version 1.7.1 *(2014-10-23)*
----------------------------

 * Fix: Correctly log `null` request arguments for `HEADERS_AND_ARGS` log level.


Version 1.7.0 *(2014-10-08)*
----------------------------

 * New: `RetrofitError`'s `getKind()` now disambiguates the type of error represented.
 * New: `HEADERS_AND_ARGS` log level displays parameters passed to method invocation along with normal
   header list.
 * New: `@Part` and `@PartMap` now support specifying the `Content-Transfer-Encoding` of their respective
   values.
 * New: `@Path`, `@Query`, and `@QueryMap` now have options for enabling or disabling URL encoding on
   names (where appropriate) and values.
 * `@Header` now accepts all object types, invoking `String.valueOf` when neccesary.
 * Attempting to use a `@Path` replacement block (`{name}`) in a query parameter now suggested `@Query` in
   the exception message.
 * Fix: Correct NPE when `Content-Type` override is specified on requests without a body.
 * Fix: `WireConverter` now correctly throws `ConversionException` on incorrect MIME types for parity with
   `ProtoConverter`.
 * Fix: Include `Content-Type` on AppEngine requests.
 * Fix: Account for NPE on AppEngine when the response URL was not automatically populated in certain cases.
 * Fix: `MockRestAdapter`'s RxJava support now correctly schedules work on the HTTP executor, specifically
   when chaining multiple requests together.
 * Experimental RxJava support updated for v0.20.


Version 1.6.1 *(2014-07-02)*
----------------------------

 * Fix: Add any explicitly-specified 'Content-Type' header (via annotation or param) to the request even
   if there is no request body (e.g., DELETE).
 * Fix: Include trailing CRLF in multi-part uploads to work around a bug in .NET MVC 4 parsing.
 * Fix: Allow `null` mock exception bodies and use the success type from the declared service interface.


Version 1.6.0 *(2014-06-06)*
----------------------------

 * New: `@Streaming` on a `Response` type will skip buffering the body to a `byte[]` before delivering.
 * When using OkHttp, version 1.6.0 or newer (including 2.0.0+) is now required.
 * The absence of a response body and an empty body are now differentiated in the log messages.
 * Fix: If set, the `RequestInterceptor` is now applied at the time of `Observable` subscription rather
   than at the time of its creation.
 * Fix: `Callback` subtypes are now supported when using `MockRestAdapter`.
 * Fix: `RetrofitError` now contains a useful message indicating the reason for the failure.
 * Fix: Exceptions thrown when parsing the response type of the interface are now properly propagated.
 * Fix: Calling `Response#getBody` when `null` body now correctly returns instead of throwing an NPE.
 * Experimental RxJava support updated for v0.19.
 * The `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` headers are no longer automatically added to the header list
   on the `Request` object. This reverts erroneous behavior added in v1.5.0. Custom `Client` implementations
   should revert to adding these headers based on the `TypedInput` body of the `Request`.


Version 1.5.1 *(2014-05-08)*
----------------------------

 * New: `@PartMap` annotation accepts a `Map` of key/value pairs for multi-part.
 * Fix: `MockRestAdpater` uses the `ErrorHandler` from its parent `RestAdapter`.
 * Experimental RxJava support updated for v0.18 and is now lazily initialized.


Version 1.5.0 *(2014-03-20)*
----------------------------

 * New: Support for AppEngine's [URL Fetch](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/urlfetch/)
   HTTP client.
 * New: Multipart requests of unknown length are now supported.
 * New: HTTP `Content-Type` can be overridden with a method-level or paramter header annotation.
 * New: Exceptions from malformed interface methods now include detailed information.
 * Fix: Support empty HTTP response status reason.
 * If an `ErrorHandler` is supplied it will be invoked for `Callback` and `Observable` methods.
 * HTTP `PATCH` method using `HttpUrlConnection` is no longer supported. Add the
   [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp) jar to your project if you need this behavior.
 * Custom `Client` implementations should no longer set `Content-Type` or `Content-Length` headers
   based on the `TypedInput` body of the `Request`. These headers will now be added automatically
   as part of the standard `Request` header list.


Version 1.4.1 *(2014-02-01)*
----------------------------

 * Fix: `@QueryMap`, `@EncodedFieldMap`, and `@FieldMap` now correctly detect `Map`-based parameter
   types.


Version 1.4.0 *(2014-01-31)*
----------------------------

 * New: `@Query` and `@EncodedQuery` now accept `List` or arrays for multiple values.
 * New: `@QueryMap` and `@EncodedQueryMap` accept a `Map` of key/value pairs for query parameters.
 * New: `@Field` now accepts `List` or arrays for multiple values.
 * New: `@FieldMap` accepts a `Map` of name/value pairs for form URL-encoded request bodies.
 * New: `Endpoint` replaces `Server` as the representation of the remote API root. The `Endpoints`
   utility class contains factories methods for creating instances. `Server` and `ChangeableServer`
   are now deprecated.
 * `SimpleXmlConverter` and `JacksonConverter` now have a default constructor.
 * `Response` now includes the URL.
 * Fix: Hide references to optional classes to prevent over-eager class verifiers from
   complaining (e.g., Dalvik).
 * Fix: Properly detect and reject interfaces which extend from other interfaces.


Version 1.3.0 *(2013-11-25)*
----------------------------

 * New: Converter module for SimpleXML.
 * New: Mock module which allows simulating real network behavior for local service interface
   implementations. See 'mock-github-client' example for a demo.
 * New: RxJava `Observable` support! Declare a return type of `Observable<Foo>` on your service
   interfaces to automatically get an observable for that request. (Experimental API)
 * Fix: Use `ObjectMapper`'s type factory when deserializing (Jackson converter).
 * Multipart POST requests now stream their individual part bodies.
 * Log chunking to 4000 characters now only happens on the Android platform.


Version 1.2.2 *(2013-09-12)*
----------------------------

 * Fix: Respect connection and read timeouts on supplied `OkHttpClient` instances.
 * Fix: Ensure connection is closed on non-200 responses.


Version 1.2.1 *(2013-08-30)*
----------------------------

 * New: Converter for [Wire protocol buffers](http://github.com/square/wire)!


Version 1.2.0 *(2013-08-23)*
----------------------------

 * New: Additional first-party converters for Jackson and Protocol Buffers! These are provided
   as separate modules that you can include and pass to `RestAdapter.Builder`'s `setConverter`.
 * New: `@EncodedPath` and `@EncodedQuery` annotations allow provided path and query params that
   are already URL-encoded.
 * New: `@PATCH` HTTP method annotation.
 * Fix: Properly support custom HTTP method annotations in `UrlConnectionClient`.
 * Fix: Apply `RequestInterceptor` during method invocation rather than at request execution time.
 * Change `setDebug` to `setLogLevel` on `RestAdapter` and `RestAdapter.Builder` and provide
   two levels of logging via `LogLevel`.
 * Query parameters can now be added in a request interceptor.


Version 1.1.1 *(2013-06-25)*
----------------------------

 * Fix: Ensure `@Headers`-defined headers are correctly added to requests.
 * Fix: Supply reasonable connection and read timeouts for default clients.
 * Fix: Allow passing `null` for a `@Part`-annotated argument to remove it from the multipart
   request body.


Version 1.1.0 *(2013-06-20)*
----------------------------

 * Introduce `RequestInterceptor` to replace `RequestHeaders`. An interceptor provided to the
   `RestAdapter.Builder` will be called for every request and allow setting both headers and
   additional path parameter replacements.
 * Add `ErrorHandler` for customizing the exceptions which are thrown when synchronous methods
   return non-200 error codes.
 * Properly parse responses which erroneously omit the "Content-Type" header.


Version 1.0.2 *(2013-05-23)*
----------------------------

 * Allow uppercase letters in path replacement identifiers.
 * Fix: Static query parameters in the URL are now correctly appended with a separating '?'.
 * Fix: Explicitly allow or forbid `null` as a value for method parameters.
   * `@Path` - Forbidden
   * `@Query` - Allowed
   * `@Field` - Allowed
   * `@Part` - Forbidden
   * `@Body` - Forbidden
   * `@Header` - Allowed


Version 1.0.1 *(2013-05-13)*
----------------------------

 * Fix: Correct bad regex behavior on Android.


Version 1.0.0 *(2013-05-13)*
----------------------------

Initial release.
